# Opens the door to Chabo

may work with other CSB doors as well. Right now its is hard coded for the A door since only losers live in B

# To unlock the door:

- place your credentials in a file `src/secrets.js` and export as `pw` and `log`
- call `unlockDoor()` in src/index.js

Might be a good idea to use process.env instead of static js-file
